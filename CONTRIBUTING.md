# Contributing to Mozilla Italia l10n Guide

Thank you for stopping by the Mozilla Italia l10n Guide!

This collaborative guide aims to involve volunteers in the creation of a manual/translation workflow based on the actual needs and feedback of localizers.

The guide is conceived as a sort of manual for volunteers joining the [Mozilla Italia](https://www.mozillaitalia.org/) l10n team (a group of volunteers translating [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)’s products and activities for Italian users).  
**However we believe in the Open philosophy, therefore we welcome fellow localizers from other communities and languages to participate, discuss, give their input and remix or adapt the guide for their own needs.**

This document will explain you the basics of how to contribute to the localization guide.

## Behavior

Firstly, please have a look at our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
It covers typical scenarios in a localization team, such as the proper way to undertake a translation project or a QA (a.k.a review  session), as well as interactions with your reviewer and fellow contributors.  
Please report to @kitsunenosarat in case of conflict with other contributors.

## Roles and tasks

As you can see from the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), this project calls for the interaction of two different “teams”:
- **Senior translators:** veteran members of a localization community, with experience of coordinating with others in a long-term project.  
ROLE: write a first draft of the guide based on their experiences.

- **New volunteers:** a (we hope!) as diverse as possible group of contributors ranging from independent translators to occasional contributors down to people at their first translation experience. The more different are the contributors’ background, the more comprehensive will the guide be!  
ROLE:
 1. read or download the first draft of the guide on [GitBooks](https://kitsunenosarat.gitbooks.io/mozilla-italia-l10n-guide/content/)
 2. test the guide on a short translation project (Italian only)^
 3. contribute to the second draft with their feedback on this experience.

^ Note: During the testing you may be asked to register a free account on [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/), the dedicated online translation platform of Mozilla, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), the Mozilla Wiki for developers, or install and use free, open source aided translation tools such as [OmegaT](http://omegat.org/) or [Poedit](https://poedit.net/).

**For Non-Italian users**  
You’ll find a [subproject](https://github.com/kitsunenosaraT/Mozilla-Italia-l10n-guide/projects/2) dedicated to the English version of the guide. You are very welcome to:
1. give lots of feedback, pointing out mistakes and adding examples, exceptions or peculiarity of your language;
2. use this draft as reference material to create a new localization manual for your language and/or community.

## Communication channels

1. **GitHub**  
The localization guide is hosted on GitHub, a web platform conceived for collaborative work, that easily keeps track of who contributed what.
If you already have a GitHub account, please come and introduce yourself in issue #20. If you don’t have one, you can always register [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) (It’s free!)

2. **Email**  
GitHub gives you a free and safe account, but if you don’t feel like to register your data on a new site just for the sake of one project, we respect that.  
If you’d rather communicate through email, get in touch with [Sara T.](https://mozillians.org/u/sara_t/) We’ll incorporate your contributions on GitHub for you, giving you the appropriate credit.

3. **Mozilla Italia forum**  
If you are a “community kind of guy/gal”, you can also choose to register an account at the [Mozilla Italia Forum](https://forum.mozillaitalia.org/). You will receive all the instructions, resources and updates, as well as give back your feedback in [this thread](https://forum.mozillaitalia.org/index.php?topic=68578.0).  
_Tip!_ The Mozilla Italia Forum is the pulsing heart of the Italian community. We don’t just do localization, there are a ton of nice activities and discussions going on. Since you’re already there, please have a look around!

## How to contribute on GitHub
- **Become a collaborator**  
If you choose to contribute through GitHub, the first step is introduce yourself in issue #20. You can also take a short survey in issue #7 to help us learn more about your motives and aspirations.

- **Check issues**  
After that, we suggest to use the [project page](https://github.com/kitsunenosaraT/Mozilla-Italia-l10n-guide/projects/) for easier browsing through issues. Watch out for these two columns:

  - **Read & Review**  
Read the various thematic chapters of the guide and leave your feedback in the dedicated issue!

  - **Translate** (Italian only)  
Pick a mini-translation project and start translating, applying what you learned in the guide!

  Alternatively you can directly filter [issues](https://github.com/kitsunenosaraT/Mozilla-Italia-l10n-guide/issues) using the labels:

  `good first bug`: a good starting point to introduce yourself and helping us to understand how to make use of your talents;

  `for new volunteers` and `we need your opinion!`: you can freely leave your feedback or questions;

  `help wanted`: if you’d like to be assigned a particular task;

  `translation test`: if you’re itching to translate something!

If you want to propose a consistent change you’ve written, please make your changes in a  fork, then make a pull request.

GitHub provides a [good walkthrough](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) on how to manage forks. Also, if you need any help, we’re here for you!

_Note_: If you still don’t feel confident enough to make this passage, email the edited file to [Sara T.](https://mozillians.org/u/sara_t/), and we’ll integrate your changes for you, giving  the proper credits.

Now that you’re ready to start, have a nice time localizing!
