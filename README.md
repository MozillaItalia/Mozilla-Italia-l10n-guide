# Mozilla Italia l10n Guide

### The localization guide made by volunteers localizers for volunteer localizers!

## Welcome!

Thank you for stopping by the Guide of the Mozilla Italia l10n (localization) team.

We are a group of volunteers passionate about localization and Open Software, our goal is to make Mozilla’s products, events and core values accessible for Italian users.

The guide is conceived as a sort of manual for volunteers joining the [Mozilla Italia](https://www.mozillaitalia.org/) l10n team (a group of volunteers translating [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)’s products and activities for Italian users).  
**However we believe in the Open philosophy, therefore we welcome fellow localizers from other communities and languages to participate, discuss, give their input and remix or adapt the guide for their own needs.**

Does it sounds like fun? Would you like be a part of our team? Then read further to know the details.

### What are we doing?

Mozilla Italia has a renowned tradition of providing high quality and comprehensive localization just by resorting to the good will of volunteer translators.

We always need the talent and passion of new volunteers to keep this project alive, however it’s not easy to get a truly continuative collaboration. Lately we started to wonder why…

#### The problem
* translation resources and instructions all over the place

* time-consuming, impractical  workflow

* not enough coordination and general keeping in touch with volunteers

* probably, a lot more things that we failed to take in account

#### The solution
* open a dialogue between senior localizers and new volunteers on the localization workflow, resources and instruments

* use feedback obtained by volunteers to write a comprehensive and localizer-friendly manual

* have the volunteers apply this guide on real localization projects for Mozilla Italia

**Hence, it starts the collaborative writing of the Mozilla Italian l10n Guide.**  
We hope that our work will be read, reused and re-mixed by other l10n communities in the world to develop their very own localization workflow.

### What does it take to become a contributor?
* good command of the English language, *very* good command of the Italian language^

* an interest in the world of Open Software (you don’t necessarily have to be a technologist or some kind of engineer, many of our finest translators started as simple satisfied users of Firefox and other Mozilla products!)

* commitment to follow the translation project assigned to you through time, to make an effort and comply with Mozilla Italia localization guidelines

^ Alternatively, if you belong to a country different from Italy, you still can (and are very welcome to!) join the discussions in English and adapt the guide to your native language.
