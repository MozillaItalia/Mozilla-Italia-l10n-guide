# Mozilla Italia l10n Guide

### The localization guide made by volunteers localizers for volunteer localizers!

## Welcome!

Thank you for stopping by the Guide of the Mozilla Italia l10n (localization) team.

We are a group of volunteers passionate about localization and Open Software, our goal is to make Mozilla’s products, events and core values accessible for Italian users.

The guide is conceived as a sort of manual for volunteers joining the [Mozilla Italia](https://www.mozillaitalia.org/) l10n team (a group of volunteers translating [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)’s products and activities for Italian users).  
**However we believe in the Open philosophy, therefore we welcome fellow localizers from other communities and languages to participate, discuss, give their input and remix or adapt the guide for their own needs.**

Does it sounds like fun? Would you like be a part of our team? Then read further to know the details.

### What does it take to become a contributor?
* good command of the English language, *very* good command of the Italian language^

* an interest in the world of Open Software (you don’t necessarily have to be a technologist or some kind of engineer, many of our finest translators started as simple satisfied users of Firefox and other Mozilla products!)

* commitment to follow the translation project assigned to you through time, to make an effort and comply with Mozilla Italia localization guidelines

^ Alternatively, if you belong to a country different from Italy, you still can (and are very welcome to!) join the discussions in English and adapt the guide to your native language.

#### Contributing

We endorse the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).
Furthermore, regarding interaction between volunteer localizers, we adopt the following Mozilla Italia l10n Team Participation Guidelines:


Mozilla Italia is a community made by Mozilla’s volunteers. As such, we don’t ask you a professional commitment in our projects. Still, if you wish to join, we expect you to uphold a certain conduct while interacting with other people and with the project itself.

##### Keep your project up to date

When you start contributing in a project, remember that, just like software, web pages and contents are a work in progress: they are often updated and their translation must also be maintained up to date.
The big part of the work is to translate the project the first time, but the important part is to follow future updates of the project. Updates are usually small, but they require weekly checks for new or edited content.
When a content lacks its translation, it is shown in English instead, thus compromising accessibility for non-English users.
For this reason, it is very important that you keep following the updates of a project after the initial translation.

##### Conform to the style established in previous translations

It is important to be coherent with the language used in previous localization of the same project (or of similar project) and there are different styles used, for example a formal registry in guides or documentation, a more friendly language in web pages.
When you translate new stuff, you must always check previous translations and make use of the same terminology and style. 
The terminology used in other product must be respected.
For example, if you are translating a guide on how to use the `Private browsing` in Firefox, you have to use the standard term `Navigazione anonima` even if other translation choices are possible.

The use of a coherent terminology across projects is very important to achieve a solid experience for users of other languages.
The job of reviewers is to give translators the list of tools and terminology resources, the job of translators is to read and make use of it during the translation process.


###### Interaction with other contributors

When participating to a collaborative project, you interact with other volunteers such as yourself.
Be respectful of their time and don’t use inappropriate language or trash talking in messages.
Proper language is important, we don’t demand that you write like Alessandro Manzoni in messages, but, please, try avoiding “[SMS language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language)” or abusing acronyms.
Also, please don’t replace *ch* with *k* or similar abbreviations in Italian, it is  an aberrant behaviour and makes messages difficult and annoying to read.



##### Follow suggestions

If reviewers share tips or suggest to change translation, try to follow advices. If you don’t agree, try to be propositive and offer alternative changes in a respectful discussion.
Sometime suggestions are made according to previous translations and maintaining a coherent terminology across projects is very important.
We realize reading pages over pages of documentation can be time consuming. However if a reviewer encourages you to read guidelines or instructions, please make the effort and go through it carefully before asking for help.
Not wasting other people’s time over questions that have already been answered is a sign of consideration toward your fellow community members.

##### Provide your availability

When you are engaged in a translation project, it is very important to provide a means of contact (email, forum account etc.) for us to get in touch with you.
We realize that community members have sometimes very little time to spare for volunteer activities. It is important for our organization to know general availability of our team. Because of that we ask you to communicate if you’re going to be busy for an extended period and don’t wish to be contacted during that time.
We don’t demand you to be always reachable, but we wish to know if we can count on you for a project in a specific range of time.
Pages on Mozilla sites are assigned certain deadlines, and in order to meet them it is important to divide work among available members.
