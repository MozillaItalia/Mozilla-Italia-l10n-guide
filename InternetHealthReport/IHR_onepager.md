# 2018 Internet Health Report

## The Internet Health Report is Mozilla’s open source initiative to document and explain what’s happening to the health of the internet.
**2017 has been called a *”terrible year for tech”*.** Headlines about troubling aspects of the internet have been everywhere. But people around the world are also saying things, teaching things and building things to tackle these challenges.

**More people are opening their eyes every day to the impact the internet has** on our societies, economies and personal well-being. We are beginning to see the health of the Internet as not just a technical issue, but a human one.

The report aims to connect the dots and look for patterns between often siloed issues – to look at the human experience of the internet as a whole.

It features global insights and perspectives across five issues: **privacy and security**, **openness**, **digital inclusion**, **web literacy** and **decentralization**.
It also spotlights three big issues: __Securing the Internet of Things__, __Understanding ‘Fake News’__, and __Too Big Tech__?

**We, as humans, can change the Internet for the better.** This report is a resource and call to action for everyone who is ready, in ways big and small, to take on this challenge.
