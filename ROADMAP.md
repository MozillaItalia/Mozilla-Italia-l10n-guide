# Mozilla Italia l10n Guide Roadmap

Welcome to the Mozilla Italia l10n Guide roadmap!

This collaborative guide aims to involve volunteers in the creation of a manual/translation workflow based on the actual needs and feedback of localizers.

The guide is conceived as a sort of manual for volunteers joining the [Mozilla Italia](https://www.mozillaitalia.org/) l10n team (a group of volunteers translating [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)’s products and activities for Italian users).  
**However we believe in the Open philosophy, therefore we welcome fellow localizers from other communities and languages to participate, discuss, give their input and remix or adapt the guide for their own needs.**

This document lists the main steps in the development of the collaborative localization guide made by volunteer localizers, for volunteer localizers!

**1 – Collecting resources**  
`For senior localizers`  
Gathering pre-existing documentation and resources that may be useful in this repository.

**2 – First draft**  
`For senior localizers`  
Organizing said resources in a first, very temporary draft of the localization guide (in Italian).

**3 – Recruiting**  
`For senior localizers` `For new volunteers`  
Gathering, through our communication channels, volunteer localizers. May be occasional collaborators, localizers from other open source communities and even people at their first translation experience.

**4 – Testing**  
`For new volunteers`  
Read the draft and apply it in brief translation projects. Take notes of any impression and problem.

**5 – Feedback**  
`For senior localizers` `For new volunteers`  
Collecting feedback about the collaborators’ experience and impression on every aspect of the translation process, from tools to interpersonal relations with senior localizers.

**6 – Discussion**  
`For senior localizers` `For new volunteers`  
Opening dialogue between senior localizers and new volunteers to discuss changes and integrations to implement.

**7 – Second Draft**  
`For senior localizers*` `*For new volunteers*`  
Implementing changes of step 6 in the guide.

**8 – Rinse and Repeat**  
`For senior localizers` `For new volunteers`  
Repeating steps 4-7 until a consensus is reached.

**9 – Publication**  
`For senior localizers` `For new volunteers`  
Publishing the guide on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and starting to use it as a reference for newcomers.

**10 – We go international!**  
`For senior localizers` `For new volunteers`  
Translating the guide into English so that it may be used/adapted/expanded upon by other communities.
