# Mozilla Italia l10n Guide Roadmap

Welcome to the Mozilla Italia l10n Guide roadmap!<br>
In this document we list the main steps we'll take in the development of this collaborative writing of a localization guide made from volunteer localizers for volunteer localizers!

### 1  Collecting resources
Gathering pre-existing documentation and resources that may be useful in this repository.

### 2 First draft
Organizing said resources in a first, highly tentative, draft of the localization guide.

### 3 Recruiting
Gathering through our communication channels contributors interested in becoming volunteer localizers for Mozilla Italia. May be occasional collaborators, localizers from other Open Source communities and even people at their first translation experience.

### 4 Testing
Having the contributors read the draft and apply it in brief translation projects.

### 5 Feedback
Collecting feedback about the collaborators' experience and impression on every aspect of the translation process, from tools to interpersonal relations with senior localizers.

### 6 Discussion
Opening dialogue between senior localizers and new volunteers to discuss changes and integrations to implement.

### 7 Second Draft
Implementing changes of step 6 in the guide.

### 8 Rise and Repeat
Repeating steps 4-7 until a consensus is reached.

### 9 Publication
Publishing the guide on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and starting to use it as a reference for newcomers.

### 10 We go international!
Translating the guide in English so that it may be used/adapted/expanded upon by other communities.
